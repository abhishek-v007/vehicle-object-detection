# Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-object-detection.git

cd vehicle-object-detection

2. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

1. Start the front-end development server:

npm start

2. Start the back-end server:

python app.py

# Architecture

The project consists of the following components:
// Front-end

The front-end is built using React and includes:

    A navigation bar
    A form for uploading images
    A section to display both the original and processed images

// Back-end

The back-end is built using Flask and includes:

    An API endpoint for handling image processing tasks
    Object detection using OpenCV
    Recognizing and counting various types of vehicles

# Docker

The project is containerized using Docker.

    Dockerfile specifies the application's environment
    docker-compose.yml file specifies the application's services

# Testing

To test the application, follow the instructions in the Usage section. Use the provided front-end user interface to upload an image, and observe the results of the object detection.

# Deployment

To deploy the application using Docker:

    Build the Docker image:

docker-compose build

Start the application:

docker-compose up

Access the web application at http://localhost:3000.
